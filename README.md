Fundamentals of Natural Language Processing II

It is a brief project that I conducted to study the NLTK library combined with the Scikit-learn's Naive Bayes classifier. I am interested in studying the possibilities that the combination of  Natural Language Processing and Automatic/Machine Learning offers. I have taken fundamentals from https://www.kaggle.com/, https://nlp.stanford.edu/ and https://stackabuse.com/.
